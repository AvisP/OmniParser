📢 [[Project Page](https://microsoft.github.io/OmniParser/)] [[V2 Blog Post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/omniparser-v2-turning-any-llm-into-a-computer-use-agent/)] [[Models V2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0)] [[Models V1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser)] [[HuggingFace Space Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/OmniParser-v2)]

**OmniParser** is a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured and easy-to-understand elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. 

The original repo had lots of issues with docker container that had the target windows OS, but in this example it can directly capture form the OS where it is running and process request

- Directly works on the OS, no need for docker

  To Do
  - [] Add Support for communicating with local models (ollama/custom)
  - [] Fix issues happening with newline/ backspace character sometimes

## Install 
First clone the repo, and then install environment:
```python
cd OmniParser
conda create -n "omni" python==3.12
conda activate omni
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have the V2 weights downloaded in weights folder (ensure caption weights folder is called icon_caption_florence). If not download them with:
```
   # download the model checkpoints to local directory OmniParser/weights/
   for f in icon_detect/{train_args.yaml,model.pt,model.yaml} icon_caption/{config.json,generation_config.json,model.safetensors}; do huggingface-cli download microsoft/OmniParser-v2.0 "$f" --local-dir weights; done
   mv weights/icon_caption weights/icon_caption_florence
```
## Examples:
We put together a few simple examples in the demo.ipynb. 

## Gradio Demo
To run gradio demo, simply run:
```python
python gradio_demo.py
```

## Model Weights License
For the model checkpoints on huggingface model hub, please note that icon_detect model is under AGPL license since it is a license inherited from the original yolo model. And icon_caption_blip2 & icon_caption_florence is under MIT license. Please refer to the LICENSE file in the folder of each model: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser.
